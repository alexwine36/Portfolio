- Activities and societies: Audio Recording TechnicianActivities and societies: Audio Recording Technician

- Involved in multiple plays and in the Improv club. Also active in researching reasoning behind stalking behavior, in an attempt to keep college students safe from these behaviors.

- There was no Audio Recording program at the school. When I first arrived at the school I spoke to the head of the Video Technology Department and, I told him that I wanted to create an Audio Recording Program for the use of the students at the college. Within six months the program was up and running and, there was a recording program for every student to use. Then the project grew to the community involving the chance to record the Newton Mid-Kansas Symphony Orchestra. The second concert they had I was requested by the Director, Thomas W. Douglas. The recording program also gave me the chance to record genres I had never had exposure to and, to meet people I wouldnâ€™t have otherwise been exposed to.
