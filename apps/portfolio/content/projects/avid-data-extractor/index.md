# The problem
  - Managers needed to be able to access received customer reviews regarding the sales team, design selection, warranty and construction process. 
# The Solution
  - Developed scraping algorithm to collect aggregated results from Avid Reports.
  - Saved collected results to PostgreSQL database to pull into Tableau. Once in Tableau, these results were then used for performance dashboards.
