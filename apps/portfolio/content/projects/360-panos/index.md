# The Problem
How to interest clients in purchasing a lot they have never seen: photograph and display 360 degree panographic shots. 

# The Solution
1. Developed a web app containg a plat map and numbered lots.

2. Allowed client to select the lots containing 360 panoramic shots.
3. Displayed the lot with a 360 panorama.

4. The program allowed the client to better visualize their future home on a lot, resulting in informed decisions and a place to create new memories (pictured below).

# Future Work 

This project was just the beginning of many for Abrazo Homes. Once the initial project was completed, the next task was to develop a method for automatically updating [lot availability](/projects/marksystems-graphql-v1).
