# Portfolio Packages Intro

The packages below help create the [Portfolio](https://alex-wine-portfolio.netlify.app/) website.

## Project Generation

This project was generated using a helpful package from the NX community. Using just one command.

```shell
nx generate @nx-plus/docusaurus:app my-app
```

## Documentation Generation

Documentation is automatically generated from TypeDoc and a Docusaurus plugin to source and compile it from the library packages.

<!-- ## Start your site

Run the development server:

```shell
nx serve my-app
```

Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `docs/intro.md` and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. -->
